Choose the root directory of the file system (panel on the left).\r\n2. Choose the classification scheme (panel on the center). There's two options:\r\n  - Load a classification scheme. You can obtain a classification scheme from RODA, for example.\r\n  - Create a classification scheme. \r\n3. Drag files/directories from the left to the center panel\r\n4. Choose the type of association and metadata desired. This will have impact on the number and structure of the SIPs created.\r\n5. (Optional) Inspect the created SIPs, edit metadata and content.\r\n6. Export the SIPs to a directory\r\n\r\nTo select more than one file/directory you can press SHIFT or CTRL.\r\n\r\nThe following actions are supported to edit the classification scheme:\r\n* Add node\r\n* Edit the title and the description level of the node\r\n* Move node (using drag and drop)\r\n  - Change parent\r\n  - Move to the root of the tree\r\n* Remove node\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1.
